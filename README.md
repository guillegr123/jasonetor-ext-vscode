# Jasonetor

Jasonetor (JaSONE[di]tor) - An (eventually) friendly JSON renderer and graphic editor extension for Visual Studio Code.

As a very very very early version, is not optimized, and requires internet connection. Please bear with the developer ;)

## Available Commands

## Extension Settings

None, for the time being.

## Known Issues

* Does not work without internet connection.
* Does not keep node expand and selection, when JSON is edited.

- Node selection highlighting.
